# QEMU-helper

Bored of writing tons of commands to start a virtual machine? For that reason i built QEMU Helper, this simple bash script makes you able to do all QEMU common features but typing far less words. 
It also keeps the performance and power of QEMU so you can enjoy it while using QEMU Helper to create virtual disks and virtual machines! We don't have plans to add a GUI in the future, the basis of this project is
exactly that, a lightweight command-line program that helps you to create your VMs while keeping QEMU's performance.
